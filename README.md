# WorksheetMate

A web-based worksheet generator.

## Description

WorksheetMate is a web-based worksheet generator that provides a question bank and a set of tools for creating and formatting worksheets with those questions. Since each question also has an answer written up, answer keys are also easily generated.

The worksheets themselves are generated with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and some custom LaTeX classes and packages (included in the `latex` directory). [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) is used to display the math in the browser.
